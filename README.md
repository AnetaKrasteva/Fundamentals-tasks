    Remove Negatives and Reverse
Read a list of integers, remove all negative numbers from it and print the remaining elements in reversed order. In case of no elements left in the list, print "empty".
    List Manipulation Advanced
Now we will implement more complicated list commands. Again, read a list, and until you receive "end" read commands:
•	Contains {number} – check if the list contains the number. If yes, print "Yes", otherwise, print "No such number"
•	Print even – print all the numbers that are even separated by a space
•	Print odd – print all the numbers that are oddly separated by a space
•	Get sum – print the sum of all the numbers
•	Filter {condition} {number} – print all the numbers that fulfill that condition. The condition will be either '<', '>', ">=", "<="
      List Manipulation Basics
Write a program that reads a list of integers. Then until you receive "end", you will be given different commands:
•	Add {number} – add a number to the end of the list
•	Remove {number} – remove a number from the list
•	RemoveAt {index} – remove a number at a given index
•	Insert {number} {index} – insert a number at a given index
Note: All the indices will be valid!
When you receive the "end" command, print the final state of the list (separated by spaces).
